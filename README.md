# LaTex-Curriculum-Vitae
This CV in LaTeX is a document that uses the LaTeX typesetting language to create a professional-looking curriculum vitae.



This Latex Curriculum Vitae can be developed with some knowledge of the LaTex Language through a Website named Overleaf.
I Have also attached a Read-only link for my CV in this Repo itself.


# autoCV

A clean CV template in LaTeX along with a GitHub action that compiles the `*.tex` file and publishes a new PDF version when new changes are pushed to the repo

## Template Design

The template is designed to be clean with sections for
- Tabular sections for Work Experience, Education and Projects
- Support for including a list of publications read from a `*.bib` file
- Header with Font Awesome icons

## Quickstart
- Fork this repo (you can use the `Use this template` button)
- Modify the `cv.tex` file and push changes to your repo
- The complied PDF will be available under the `build` branch

Optionally, while forking this repo, you can get a direct link to the generated PDF which you can use on your website, LinkedIn etc. that will always point to the latest version of your CV. For this, after editing your copy of `cv.tex` and pushing changes to your repo, under Settings -> Pages, set your Github Pages source to the `build` directory
